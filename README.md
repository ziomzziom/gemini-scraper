This script initializes a web scraper using the colly library, targets HTML elements with the class .search-result, 
extracts the relevant information, and outputs it as JSON via a simple HTTP server running on localhost:8080.

Adjust the CSS selector and the URL in the script based on the structure of the Gemini webpage you're scraping.
